Real-Time Arbitrage Trading System
Arbitrage is a trading algorithm where the trader monitors the prices of an asset, usually stocks, across different markets to identify where its price is the lowest and highest. The stock is purchased at a low price and sold at a high price. But since markets tend to adjust prices quickly, speed is of utmost importance to make profits. Here I tried to leverage the speed and parallelization offered by Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to make an Arbitrage Trading system. The FPGA used in this system is the DE1 SoC by Altera/ Intel.
